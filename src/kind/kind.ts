/** 
 * ### {@link kind `Kind`}
 * 
 * - {@link https://stackblitz.com/edit/hkt?file=src%2Fkind.ts Sandbox}
 * - {@link https://tsplay.dev/WzqD2m TypeScript playground}
 * 
 * ### Problem statement
 * 
 * What problem(s) does the 
 * {@link https://github.com/ahrjarrett/any-ts `any-ts`} encoding attempt to solve?
 * 
 * > _Problem:_ current HKT encodings require constraints to be applied "after the fact" 
 * (inside the body of the HKT), rather than at the declaration site; this has historically 
 * led to drift, and makes their APIs awkward to use and difficult to grok
 * 
 * > _Problem:_ because arguments are applied _by name_ rather than _by position_, every
 * new HKT encoding increases the fragmentation of the ecosystem, making the interop
 * story a nightmare (and again, DX suffers).
 * 
 * ### Proposition
 * 
 * {@link kind `Kind`} solves both problems by treating
 * constraints and arguments the same: **as simple arrays**.
 *
 * With {@link kind `Kind`}:
 * 
 * 1. constraints are applied positionally, at the time of declaration; and
 * 2. arguments are interpreted positionally, at the time of application.
 *  
 * As it turns out, taking this approach gives us something else for free: since an argument's
 * position corresponds 1:1 with its address, we're also able to _apply_ arguments using an array, 
 * which, since that's how arguments are typically applied in JavaScript, feels comfy and quite
 * natural, even for those without much experience with type-level programming.
 * 
 * @example
 *  import type { Kind } from "any-ts"
 * 
 *  // shorthand for declaring a unary function, stolen from `free-types` by @geoffreytools
 *  interface Duplicate extends Kind<1> { 
 *    // since there can only be one "return value", it lives at index `-1`:
 *    [-1]: [this[0], this[0]] // accessing `this[1]` raises a type error, since this kind is unary
 *  }
 *  
 *  // constrains the first argument to a string
 *  interface Capitalize extends Kind<[string]> {
 *    // Note that we can use `this[0]` _as a string_ in the body of the function:
 *    [-1]: globalThis.Capitalize<this[0]>
 *  }
